# kotlin-fit-proto-playground
Small repository for testing my messing around with Kotlinx Protobuf. This takes in a schema generated by a previous project in proto2. Attempting to validate and learn more about what its actually doing.

## Description
This playground project demonstrates how to utilize the `kotlin-fit-converter-lib` library to work with .proto schemas and generate real classes using the `grpc-kotlin` tooling.

## Requirements
- Kotlin 1.5.0 or later
- kotlin-fit-converter-lib
- grpc-kotlin

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/kotlin-proto-class-generator.git`
2. Open the project in your favorite Kotlin IDE.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the necessary .proto schema generated by the `kotlin-fit-converter-lib` project. Or any .proto schema.
2. Run the grpc-kotlin tooling to generate classes based on the .proto schema. You'll need to run the generateProto build task.
4. Start experimenting with the generated classes to understand their structure and functionalities.
